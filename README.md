# PhotoFinish
HTML5 and Javascript App for detecting and taking pictures at a finish line of a race.

I was looking on the internet for web applications or apps that would allow someone to capture a "photo finish" of a race. I found some, but they were either broken or detected motion throughout the entire video stream instead of a specified area. That's why this was created.

You can use a USB or built-in webcam and see a preview of the area you want to capture. Then you can specify the area that is your finish line and the application will detect for motion in that area and create a snapshot.
